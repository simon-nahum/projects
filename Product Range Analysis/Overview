E-Commerce Product Range Analysis
Introduction
Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze the product range of an online store.

To do so we shall analyze the following:

Basket Analysis: We will find items that are typically bought together in the same invoice.

Assortment: Using keywords in the product description we will try to identify the main categories of products.

Returned Items: We will analyze the distribution of the ratio of returns of items and identify the products with highest ratio.

Popularity: We will identify the most popular items, and analyze distribution of popularity.

Seasonality: We will plot revenues and average invoice sizes by date to see if there is any seasonal pattern.
